Tempo is the second app made by [CUAppDev](http://cuappdev.org), an engineering project team at Cornell University focused on mobile app development. Tempo allows users to post their song of the day, and discover what others are listening to. Users can also connect their Spotify accounts to add songs to their Spotify playlists. You can view our [release notes](RELEASENOTES.md) to learn more about the progress of Tempo.
